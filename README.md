# MindfulScape
A mindful experience in VR. The user enters a relaxing environment, where they can interact with nature.
The user is prompted to engage in grounding tasks, like counting colors around them, watching bunnies hop, and listening quietly for the sound of a puppy snoring. 
Tasks are drawn from traditional grounding techniques, and the environment was designed specifically for a calm, serene experience in VR that anyone can operate.
